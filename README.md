# Introduction

Maintenance tracker is an app that makes managing of repair/maintenance operations very easy and seamless.

With a very intuitive frontend and a robust nodejs API, all that is required, is for the users to register an account [here](https://veraclins-frontend.herokuapp.com/) and create requests as well as manage their requests.

# API

The api is also available [here](https://veraclins-m-tracker.herokuapp.com/api/v1)
