# Maintenance-Tracker
This is my second attempt at the Andela Maintenancace Tracker Challenge

# Reason
The first attempt used the Feature Branch workflow instead of the gitflow workflow.
This was because I failed to notice the "#gitflow-workflow" at the end of the recommendation link

Figured it is better I tried to do it right even if it may no longer be considered.

This will also be the base for the Challenge 2
